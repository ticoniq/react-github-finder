# Github Finder App

App to search Github users and display their info. This is part of my React Front To Back 2022 course and is the most up to date version of this project.

## Usage

Rename **_.env.example_** to **_.env_**

You can use the Github API without a personal token, but if you want to use your token, add it to the .env file

Learn how to create a token [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

### Install Dependencies

npm install
```
